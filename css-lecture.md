---

## Outline
- Applications of OOP to CSS  
- Selectors and Specificity Hell
  - Flattening your CSS
  - Naming Practices (keep it consistent)
- File Structure
- Helpful Tools/Resources 
  - prefixer
  - scss transpiler
  - minifier [hold off until the end]

Note: 
- how can we apply OOP cleanliness/predictability/practices to Styling
  - Inheritance, Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism
  - decoupling -- each block (or object) has it's own set of concerns and doesn't intrude on any others'
  - instead of repetition of state/functionality, we're focussing on repetition of style
  - what is an object in JS isn't always an object in 
- flattening => more efficient CSS
